# Merge Sort
Merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm. It works by recursively breaking down a problem into two or more sub-problems of the same or related type, until these become simple enough to be solved directly.

## How it works
1. If it is only one element in the list it is already sorted, return
2. Divide the list recursively into two halves until it can no more be divided
3. Merge the smaller lists into new list in sorted order

## Space complexity
The space complexity of Merge sort is O(n). This means that this algorithm takes a lot of space and may slower down operations for the last data sets.

## Time complexity
Best case - O(nLogn)
Worst case - O(nLogn)
