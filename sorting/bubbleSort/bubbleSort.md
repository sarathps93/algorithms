# Bubble Sort
A sorting algorithm where largest values bubbles up to thhe top.

## Pseudocode
1. Start looping from with a variable called i the end of the array towards the beginning
2. Start an inner loop with a variable called j from the beginning till i - 1
3. if arr[ j ] is greater than arr[j + 1], swap those values
4. Return the array

## Big O

1. Worst & Average case : O(n ^ 2)
2. Nearly sorted data, best case: O(n)
