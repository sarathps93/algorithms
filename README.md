Sorting and Searching algorithms in JavaScript

## Why is it important?

Having a good working knowledge about Sorting and Searching alogithms is really essential for any developer so that they can write code which is high performing.

The main two parameters for identifying the performace of any particular piece of code are by analysing **Time complexitie**s and **Space complexities**

Performance is often measured using a Big(O) notation.
Few examples are

o(1) --> constant time(Best case)
o(logn)
o(n)
o(nlogn)
o(n^2)
